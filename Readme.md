# Extra Logical  
Adds a few extra logic devices where they seem to be "missing". As of now, the following devices are added:  
- `d104`: [Hardsuit, Advanced Tablet] accesses your glasses slot
- `d109`: [Hardsuit, Advanced Tablet] accesses your left hand
- `d110`: [Hardsuit, Advanced Tablet] accesses your right hand

Aliasing is supported for all devices.

# How to Install  
- Install [BepInEx 5.4](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.22)
- Dowload the [latest release](releases/latest)
- Drop the dll into `<Game Folder>/BepInEx/plugins`

# Multiplayer compatible?  
It should be, but only if you can get BepInEx working on the server. If you're running on Linux, good luck.
